# Data
-TPC_data.csv contains data for each experimental microcosm (1056 total representing 22 genotypes) with initial and final population counts, replicate ID, and genotype ("clone") name. 

-two_clone_TPC.csv contains TPC data collected for the two genotypes (AXS and CU4106) used in the experimental evolution assay with initial and final population counts, replicate ID, and genotype ("clone") name. 

-FlowCytData.csv contains all compiled data from the experimental evolution assay using flow cytometry, as described under the Results sub-section "Consequences of G Ã— E: differential sorting of standing genetic variation across temperatures" and associated methods in the main text

-Flow_Cyt_Data.zip contains all raw data from each individual cytometry data

# Code

-Liu_et_at_code.R contains code to reproduce Figures 2, Figures 3A-G, and Figures 4D-F. Code requires TPC_data.csv, two_clone_TPC.csv, and FlowCytData.csv to run.
